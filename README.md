# Card Game Simulator
The **Card Game Simulator** is a Java console app that shuffles a 52-card deck, deals to 4 players, and determines a winner based on matching ranks. In case of a tie, higher card values decide the winner. This project demonstrates Java skills in collections, control structures, and logic for building interactive applications.
